Lorem Ipsum has been the industry`s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

NPS gives you the flexibility to opt for a dynamic and automatic allocation of your portfolio in case you do not want to exercise an Active choice. This option is called the Auto choice.\n\nIn Auto choice, your money will be invested in asset classes - E, C and G - in defined proportions based on your age. As individual’s age increases, exposure to Equity and Corporate Debt is gradually reduced and that in Government Securities is increased. Depending upon the risk appetite of subscriber, there are three different options available within Auto Choice-Aggressive, Moderate and Conservative.\n\n\u2022\tAggressive (LC-75) – Maximum Equity exposure is 75% up to the age of 35\n\u2022\tModerate (LC-50) - Maximum Equity exposure is 50% up to the age of 35\n\u2022\tConservative (LC-25) – Maximum Equity exposure is 25% up to the age of 35',
